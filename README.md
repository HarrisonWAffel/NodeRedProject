# Reddit Tone Analysis using IBM Node Red and Watson NLP

A IBM Node Red Flow used in my "Impact of AI on humanity" course which ran in spring of 2020. The flow utilzes the Reddit API to get a list of posts from r/all, filtered by either hot, new, top, or convoversal. It displays a table of posts titles and the resulting tone determined by watson.

To use this flow simply import the JSON file within this repository into your own node red workspace.
